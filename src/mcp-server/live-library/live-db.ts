 * Strategy: `mode=ro&immutable=1` URI. `immutable=1` is essential because
 * Live's DBs are in WAL journal mode — opening read-only without immutable
 * fails when Live is not running (no `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars to read), and
 * is risky when Live is running (write contention). `immutable=1` skips
 * locking and journaling setup, so we cannot perturb anything Live is doing.
 *
 * Tradeoff: under `immutable=1`, our reads may see torn pages if Live
 * writes during the query. Live writes are infrequent enough that this is
 * acceptable for read-only library queries the user can re-issue.
 *
 * Hard rules: SELECT-only, no `ATTACH … AS rw`, no write SQL ever.
