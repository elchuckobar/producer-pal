# Features

Producer Pal is an AI-powered music production assistant for Ableton Live — an
Ableton MCP server that lets any AI read, create, and modify your Live Set. Tell
the AI what you want and it uses 23 specialized tools to read, create, and
modify tracks, clips, devices, and to drive Live's UI-only workflows (Export,
Record, Max-for-Live device loading) via computer-use runbooks.

It works with virtually any AI, including its
[built-in Chat UI](/guide/chat-ui), desktop apps like
[Claude Desktop](/installation/claude-desktop) and
[Codex](/installation/codex-app), CLI tools, and web apps.

## Runbook Tools {#runbook-tools}

Runbook tools return a deterministic computer-use step plan that the caller
executes via `mcp__computer-use__*`. They do not call the Live API and do not
write to disk — they are pure recipe generators. This is the bridge between
Producer Pal's LOM-level tools and Ableton workflows that live entirely in
Live's UI (Export dialog, Arrangement recording, Max-for-Live device loading).

Each tool returns `{ steps, failModes, verify, meta }` as JSON:

- `steps` — ordered list of primitives: `screenshot`, `left_click`, `key`,
  `type`, `wait`, plus `left_mouse_down`/`mouse_move`/`left_mouse_up` for drag
  composition
- `failModes` — documented failure scenarios with detect/recovery pairs
- `verify` — post-execution checks (file existence, audio length, etc.)
- `meta` — version, locale, estimated duration

The caller (any AI agent with computer-use access) is expected to consume the
JSON, run the steps, and re-invoke the tool with corrections if a failMode
fires. Producer Pal itself never touches the desktop.

### 🔧 Render Export (`ppal-render-export`) {#ppal-render-export}

- Generate a computer-use step plan that drives Ableton Live's Export
  Audio/Video dialog (`Cmd+Shift+R`)
- Format, render range, returns/master, loop, mono, normalize, and analysis-file
  toggles (bit depth, dither, and sample rate are not exposed by this runbook —
  the caller relies on Live's current dialog defaults)
- Save target is a fully qualified path (filename + extension); the recipe
  drives the macOS save sheet via `Cmd+Shift+G`
- macOS locale hint (`abletonLocale`) selects between pixel-anchor sets when
  Live's UI is not in English/German
- 8 documented `failModes` (dialog never opens, dropdown stuck, save sheet
  missing, "File exists" prompt, render-range zero, locale drift, Beta bounce
  warning, save path inexistent)

Workflow example:

```
1. ppal-update-live-set { tempo: 124 }                 → set tempo via LOM
2. ppal-render-export   { destPath, renderStart,       → returns step-plan JSON
                          renderLength, format: "wav" }
3. Agent executes steps via mcp__computer-use__*       → drives the dialog
4. Agent reads verify checks: file exists, length ≈ renderLength
```

Render-Bracket-Position (start/length) is passed to `ppal-render-export`
directly via `renderStart`/`renderLength`; if omitted, the recipe relies on
Live's current Insert Marker and Loop bracket.

| Fail mode            | Detect                                  | Recovery                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Dialog doesn't open  | Screenshot after step 2 lacks the title | Re-focus Live, re-fire `Cmd+Shift+R`    |
| Dropdown stuck open  | Dropdown still expanded in screenshot   | Click list item (never press Escape)    |
| Save sheet missing   | No native macOS file dialog             | Render-range too short — set explicitly |
| "File exists" sheet  | Modal blocks export                     | Cancel, choose new filename             |
| Beta bounce warning  | Modal "Bounce engine" dialog            | User decision — never auto-dismiss      |
| Render length zero   | UI shows `0.0.0`                        | Pass `renderLength` explicitly          |
| Save path inexistent | Save dialog: "path does not exist"      | Re-fire `Cmd+Shift+G`, set parent dir   |
| Locale drift         | Pixel anchors miss                      | Set `abletonLocale="unknown"`, ask user |

<!--@include: ./_generated/ppal-render-export-schema.md-->

### 🔧 Record Arrangement (`ppal-record-arrangement`) {#ppal-record-arrangement}

- Generate a computer-use step plan to arm the Arrangement transport, click the
  Record button, optionally wait for a fixed duration, then stop via Spacebar
- Optional `saveAfter` step: `none`, `save` (existing path), or `save-as`
  (drives `Cmd+Shift+S` with explicit save path)
- Pre-flight assertion: `view: 'arrangement'` emits a screenshot anchor so the
  caller can verify Live is in Arrangement view before recording. The recipe
  never auto-presses Tab — Tab is a toggle and would be unsafe; the caller
  dispatches Tab if needed
- Locale-aware: shortcut-driven where possible, pixel anchors fall back to the
  same `abletonLocale` hint as the Export tool

Workflow example:

```
1. ppal-update-track { ids: "<id>", arm: true }     → arm target track via LOM
2. ppal-record-arrangement { durationSeconds: 32,   → returns step-plan JSON
                              saveAfter: "save" }
3. Agent executes: click Record button, wait 32s, Spacebar stops, Cmd+S
4. Caller checks verify.transportShouldBeStopped + setDirty
```

`durationSeconds` is what triggers the recipe to emit the wait + Spacebar-stop
steps. Without it the recipe leaves the transport running and the caller is
expected to stop it manually — `saveAfter` is then a no-op.

| Fail mode                       | Detect                           | Recovery                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| No armed track                  | Empty arrangement                | Call `ppal-update-track { ids:"<id>", arm:true }` first   |
| Record button click miss        | Record lamp stays gray           | Re-click button                                           |
| Save dialog despite `save`      | First-save case                  | Caller falls back to `save-as`                            |
| Recording keeps running         | Record lamp still red after Stop | Second Spacebar or click Record button again              |
| Locale drift                    | Pixel anchors miss               | Set `abletonLocale="unknown"`                             |
| `savePath` missing on `save-as` | `meta.notes` flags it            | No save steps emitted; re-invoke with explicit `savePath` |
| Session view still active       | Tab needed — but Tab is a toggle | Recipe screenshot-verifies before Tab                     |

<!--@include: ./_generated/ppal-record-arrangement-schema.md-->

### 🔧 Load Max-for-Live Device (`ppal-load-m4l-device`) {#ppal-load-m4l-device}

- Generate a computer-use step plan that opens Live's Browser, navigates to a
  Max-for-Live category (`max-instrument`, `max-audio-effect`,
  `max-midi-effect`, or `user`), locates an `.amxd` device by name, and drags it
  onto a target track
- Drag primitives encode the Welle-3 Settle-Timing lesson: 0.55s pause after
  `mouse_down`, 0.35s pause before `mouse_up` — `left_click_drag` is too fast
  for Browser→Track drops and routinely misses
- Optional explicit `dropX`/`dropY` overrides the computed track-header pixel
  for non-standard track-list layouts
- Returns the same `{steps, failModes, verify, meta}` envelope; `verify` echoes
  the expected device-name and category so the caller can cross- check against
  `ppal-read-device` after the drop

Workflow example:

```
1. ppal-create-track { type: "midi" }      → create empty track via LOM
2. ppal-load-m4l-device { category: "max-instrument", deviceName: "Producer_Pal" }
3. Agent executes drag: browser → track header
4. ppal-read-track                          → verify device added
```

| Fail mode                    | Detect                   | Recovery                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Browser pane closed          | No browser visible       | `Cmd+Alt+B` shortcut to toggle        |
| Category click misses        | Labels shift with scroll | Scroll category list to top first     |
| Drop on empty timeline       | Wrong track-header pixel | Supply explicit `dropX`/`dropY`       |
| `.amxd` not in category      | Search returns empty     | Switch category (`user` if user lib)  |
| Live shows compilation modal | M4L is recompiling       | Wait and surface — never auto-dismiss |
| Macro defaults differ        | Out of scope             | `ppal-update-device` after load       |

<!--@include: ./_generated/ppal-load-m4l-device-schema.md-->

## Custom Music Notation {#custom-music-notation}

Producer Pal uses a text-based music notation syntax called `bar|beat` to work
with MIDI clips. Used by [Create Clip](#ppal-create-clip),
[Update Clip](#ppal-update-clip), and [Read Clip](#ppal-read-clip). It helps
LLMs translate natural language expressions of time to the correct time
positions in Ableton Live clips and the arrangement timeline.

- **Pitches**: Standard notation (C3 = middle C, F#4, Bb2, etc.)
- **Time positions**: bar|beat format (1|1 = first beat, 2|3 = bar 2, beat 3)
- **Durations**: bar:beat format (4:0 = 4 bars, 1:2 = 1 bar + 2 beats)
- **Velocity**: Values from 1-127 (or ranges like 80-100)
- **Probability**: 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0 = always plays)
- **Bar copying**: Copy bars with `@2=1` (bar 1→2), ranges with `@2-8=1` (bar
  1→bars 2-8), or tile patterns with `@3-10=1-2` (repeat 2-bar pattern across
  bars 3-10)

## Transforms {#transforms}

Apply complex changes to clips using math expressions via
[Create Clip](#ppal-create-clip) and [Update Clip](#ppal-update-clip):

- **Transform MIDI notes**: velocity, pitch, timing, duration, probability
- **Transform audio clips**: gain, pitch shift
- **Shapes**: LFO waveforms (sine, tri, saw), ramps, curves, randomization with
  arbitrary ranges, choose from sets of values (e.g. chord notes)
- **Context variables**: Access note order (`note.index`), clip metadata
  (`clip.duration`, `clip.index`, `clip.position`, `clip.barDuration`) in
  expressions
- **Selectors**: Target specific pitch ranges (e.g., `C3:`, `C3-C5:`) or time
  ranges (e.g., `1|1-2|4:`), or both in either order (e.g., `C3 1|1-2|4:` or
  `1|1-2|4 C3:`)

## Network Control

Control Ableton Live from another computer on your local network, no extra setup
required. For fully remote control, use
[web tunnels](/installation/web-tunnels).

## Small Model Mode {#small-model-mode}

Adapts Producer Pal for less capable AI models by returning simplified
[skills](#skills) and removing advanced parameters from tool schemas. This is an
ongoing R&D effort aimed at making [local models](/installation/choose-local)
viable for completely offline, free, and private usage. Enable it in the
[Chat UI](/guide/chat-ui) settings or with `--small-model-mode` on the command
line.

## Skills {#skills}

The [Connect tool](#ppal-connect) returns a skill set that teaches the AI how to
use Producer Pal's [custom notation](#custom-music-notation),
[transforms](#transforms), device paths, and other conventions. Two variants are
available depending on [small model mode](#small-model-mode):
